        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kelly Miyamoto. I am from Cupertino California. I attended Cupertino High school from 2016-2020. During this time I participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. Throughout my first two years of high school I played for the Junior Varsity Girls Basketball team. I played point guard in which I practiced and improved my leadership skills. I also participated in marching band for all four years of high school, playing the trumpet and mellophone. Marching band helped me to improve my time management and cooperation skills, as it was a demanding activity to participate in regards to time commitment. Another area of significance was my participation in the school’s Interact club, a service based club in which I was a member of the community project committee. This allowed me to take part in planning and organizing events for members to participate in. I was also a “World Core Scholar” which is a group of students selected by teachers to mentor sophomore students in their essay writing. I was also recommended for and participated as an AVID tutor. During which, I led study groups in algebra, literature, and other subjects. I also graded papers and served as a source of communication between the students and the teacher. <br><br>

        Continuing into the next chapter of my life, I was accepted into multiple schools including the University of California Santa Cruz, Chapman University, and California Polytechnic University Pomona. I decided to go to the University of California Riverside to pursue an education in psychology. I have taken multiple classes that are applicable to many potential job fields including introductory psychology, statistics, computer science, anthropology, and many more. I have also continued my education in the Japanese language which is highly helpful in the current era in which there is increased communication between the United States and Japan. At the University of California Riverside, I maintain a 3.8 grade point average in addition to being a member of the Nikkei Student Union. The Nikkei Student Union is a Japanese social cultural club which allows students to learn more about Japanese American culture in addition to being a member of a social family within the club. In the club I mentor two third year transfer students. 
<br><br>

        Throughout my years of high school and early years of college, I have held various different jobs. I was a teacher's assistant for a Japanese summer camp throughout much of high school and my freshman year of college. This job allowed me to improve my leadership and communication skills through working with children and other aids. I helped to teach cooking, crafts, and cultural segments to sixth graders. I also worked as a server from my senior year through the summer before my sophomore year of college at Go Fish Poke Bar. This job helped me develop skills in customer service and navigating workplace settings. I also learned about filing taxes through organizing my W2 tax form. I also currently tutor trumpet to a seventh grade student on a weekly basis. During which I provide helpful information in improving technique and reading music. I also go over assignments with the student in order to improve clarity.
